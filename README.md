# University of Oregon Nosatsu Collection Repository

Our collection is themed around the Asian art on display at the JSMA and held by the school, especially the nōsatsu votive slips kept in Special Collections. We aim to provide an easily-viewable sampler of various slips, with attendant metadata, to make further research into the slips easier for students and other academics.

Exact provenance data on many of the slips is unclear, and while it turned out that tracing it was beyond the scope of this class project our hope is that our initial research can help lay the groundwork for a more extensive future project. Also, the website that currently displays the nōsatsu is extremely slow, and hard to navigate. We thought that it’d be useful to have a fast site that helps display smaller, curated examples from the larger archive, from a variety of sources within it.

The importance of the theme above suggests two primary groups that might be interested in this collection. The first are those who want easy access to data related to the nōsatsu strips to perform further research on provenance and other related topics . The second is students of various fields, such as Art History and Asian Studies, who want a convenient source without having to slog through the sluggish database system.

## Course

This Collection Project was created for the LIB350m Human Resource Data Management class taught by Franny Gaede during the Winter 2025 UO school term, a class that taught how to create data collections, the intracies of data collection, and some of the bigger collections people are building today.
