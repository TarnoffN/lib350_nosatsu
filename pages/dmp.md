# Data Management Plan

## Project Description

Our collection is themed around the Asian art on display at the JSMA and held by the school, especially the nōsatsu votive slips kept in Special Collections. We aim to provide an easily-viewable sampler of various slips, with attendant metadata, to make further research into the slips easier for students and other academics.

Exact provenance data on many of the slips is unclear, and while it turned out that tracing it was beyond the scope of this class project our hope is that our initial research can help lay the groundwork for a more extensive future project. Also, the website that currently displays the nōsatsu is extremely slow, and hard to navigate. We thought that it’d be useful to have a fast site that helps display smaller, curated examples from the larger archive, from a variety of sources within it.

The importance of the theme above suggests two primary groups that might be interested in this collection. The first are those who want easy access to data related to the nōsatsu strips to perform further research on provenance and other related topics. The second is students of various fields, such as Art History and Asian Studies, who want a convenient source without having to slog through the sluggish database system.


## Personnel, Roles & Responsibilities
Casey C. is the collection manager.
Niko T. is the repository manager.
Jacob G. is the photographer.
Jesse M. is the project manager.

## Expected Data
Our working data is stored in a google drive shared between our personnel. The drive will contain our working data, such as raw image files, selected jpgs, and any internal notes and communications.This also includes our collection builder spreadsheet, which lists detailed metadata about each entry in our digital collection. We will also utilize a github repository for our data.

## Period of Data Retention
Data shared between us and kept on the google drive and github will be kept indefinitely. None of it is connected to our school accounts, so access won’t be cut when we leave the school.

## Data Formats and Dissemination
Our end users can expect to access a .csv file containing our collection builder spreadsheet for purposes of reproduction or general use, as well as .jpg files for each of the data entries. 

## Data Storage and Preservation of Access
The csv and its related images will be kept on both github and the shared google drive. A copy will also be kept offline on an external hard drive owned by Jesse M.

## Appendix A: Data Dictionary
Files are named “notsatsu_” followed by a brief description. The name is followed by the collection it was found in, the format of the collection, the box and/or page number, the collection time, and finally the collector and donator.
Other elements of metadata include, in order:
Format: the image format
Date: the date range the nōsatsu slip was created
Collection name: The name of the collection as it appears on the University of Oregon Library database.
Collection item format: Type of item the collection item is stored within.
Collection item: Item in the library collection where this item in our collection can be found.
Collected by: The collector is the person who took the time to keep and store the Senjafuda for its collection of origin.
Donated by: In cases where the item was donated to the University of Oregon Library by someone other than the collector.
Link to collection: the link to the exact webpage where the collection is catalogued.
