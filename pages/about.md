## About Our Collection

Our collection is themed around the Asian art on display at the JSMA and held by the school, especially the nōsatsu votive slips kept in Special Collections. We aim to provide an easily-viewable sampler of various slips, with attendant metadata, to make further research into the slips easier for students and other academics. We thought that it’d be useful to have a fast site that helps display smaller, curated examples from the larger archive, from a variety of sources within it.

## The Team Behind the Project

Our team consists of four different members, including Project Manager Jesse M., Collection Manager Casey C., Repository Manager Niko T., and a Generalist as well as Photographer Jacob G. Jesse was respondsible for most of the writing including our Data Management Plan and Project Description. Casey was respondsible for most of our metadata, including categorization and collection. Niko was respondsible for creating this website, as well as organizing, creating, and troubleshooting our GitHub repository. Finally, Jacob was respondsible for photographing our various objects on display, as well as assisting in various other positions.


## Institution Credits

We'd like to thank the University of Oregon Special Collections for allowing us to procure original documentation of several of their votive slips from the Gertrude Bass Warner Nosatsu Collection, as well as Github and CollectionBuilder for facilitating the website creation process.
